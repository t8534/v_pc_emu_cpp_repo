std::vector<int> a{1,2,4} --->A (Aggregate Initialization)

This is initializer-list initialization, not aggregate, because vector is not
an aggregate — its data is stored on the heap.
You need to have #include <initializer_list> for it to work, although that
header is typically included from <vector>.
